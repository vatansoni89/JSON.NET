Demos are included in a zip file called demos.zip.
Please extract and open pluralsight.json.net.sln.
Each project has a standardized name, i.e. m2-06-error-handling demo. 
- "m2" represents module number, there are 9 modules with demos.
- "06" stands for the demo project number. Demo projects are numbered sequentially from 1 to 26 but numbering does not restart for each module.
- The last part, i.e. "error-handling-demo", is an aid to help identify demo topic.
